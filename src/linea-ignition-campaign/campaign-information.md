# Campaign Information

## Campaign Website

LPs can review the campaign information and view/claim their rewards directly through the campaign website: [https://linea-ignition.brevis.network](https://linea-ignition.brevis.network).

## Rewards Update Epoch

Rewards are updated on a **weekly** basis. After each week ends, Brevis will retrospectively attest the rewards for all LPs for the past week. LPs should see their rewards for the past week updated on each Monday or Tuesday.

The start of each epoch (and the end of last epoch) is the UTC 00:00:00 every Monday.

## Last Week Rewards

For Etherex pools: The “Last Week Rewards” displayed on the UI are the rewards allocated to the DEX pool during the past week.

For Aave and Euler pools: The "Last Week Rewards” displayed on the UI for each lending pool are the actual rewards allocated to the pool based on the calculated weights during the past week. View the [rewards calculation rules for lending pools](rewards-calculation.md#lending-pools) for details.

## TVL

The displayed TVL of Etherex pools represents the total liquidity provided to this pool by all LPs, including both in-range and out-of-range liquidity.
